The data for this project is confidential and has not been included in this repository. Only the output of the Jupyter notebook has been added. As well as the final thesis paper.

The intention of this study is to create a more accurate version of the current pipeline that aims to
bridge topic modelling with classification through the use of document analysis and labelling.
Through the comparison of a variety of topic modelling techniques, this study aims to identify
the most impactful technique for topic modelling for the given data set, and use that technique as
the input for a text classifier with the most adequate parameters to provide the highest degree of
accuracy, and ease of implementation.

Topic Modelling (through the implementation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation) was used on a dataset of interviewer notes to attempt to classify whether or not the interviewer, followed best practice and was deemed 'Bar Raising'.
